<h1>THIS GALLERY CONTAINS FACTS AND IMAGES ABOUT MY 3 FAVORITE MONKEY SPECIES</h1>
<p>This site has been made to showcase 3 of my favorite types of monkeys. This website is meant to help me understand how to use CSS and how to format websites in the future. </p>
<p>The way I organize these monkeys should challenge what I know about orienting and formatting a website and will help me make my monkey pictures and facts more engaging. </p>

<h2>Here is the japanese macaque</h2>

<p2>Also known as the "snow monkey" The japanese macaque is special due to its extremely thick coat which keeps it warm during the snowy winters of Japan. They are known to bathe in the hot springs of the Japanese mountains as a way of warming up in the snow, something no other monkeys do. </p2>

<h2>Here is the mandrill</h2>
<img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/45a86db3-6897-4a3a-aa7c-e9d8da657e6d/5571399.jpg?w=1084.125&h=1519.875" alt="Mandrill1" style=width:1250px;height:800px;">   <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mjYGB4uYgWw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Mandrill2" style=width:1225px;height:800px;">  
<p2>The male mandrill has a very brightly colored face with features that stand out heavily from the rest of its body. Only the male mandrills have such brilliantly colored features, though, as they use these features to attract female mates. This monkey also notably has huge , intimidating canines. The most notable fictional representation of a mandrill is Rafiki from the Lion King. </p2>

<h2>And finally, here is the proboscis monkey.</h2>
<img src="https://www.balisafarimarinepark.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Get-to-know-the-Proboscis-Monkey-2.jpg" alt="Prboscis1" style=width:1250px;height:800px;">  <img src="https://hakaimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/looking-at-leaf-proboscis-monkeys.jpg" alt="Proboscis2" style=width:1225px;height:800px;">  
<p2>This monkey has a really big nose, and is actually also known as the "long-nose monkey". These noses are supposedly not for any survival advantage, but are instead just used to make a louder sound, so as to attract mates from further away, and make a more impressive sound to potential mates than other male proboscis monkeys.</p2>
